# Functionality-Test-2017 |Advitiy| Electrical Subsytem|

Hello, everyone :smiley:

We are the [**Electrical Subsystem**](http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/pratham/index.php) of [**Student Satellite Team, IIT Bombay**](http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/pratham/elecSS.php). 
This is our repository where we will be maintaining the codes for functionality tests. 

</br>

The aim of functionality test is to ensure that the electrical subsystem as a whole as well as every individual component of the subsystem is tested and is proven to be bulletproof. We aim to create a generic testbench for the entire subsystem which would be based on the analysis of these tests.
Executing these tests also involves a great deal of learning in terms of Embedded C experience and debugging skills.  
The functionality Tests are being carried out on the flight hardware of the satellite. 


## Some rules/protocols to be followed if you wish to contribute to this repository:

- Corresponding to a particular task, there would be a sub-repository(folder) 

- Ensure that the name of the folder gives an abstract idea of its contents

- Make sure that you include a README file for each folder which gives a brief description of the task, fucntion of the individual files, how to run the main code and an invitation to the opensource community for collaboration. You can have a look at these READMEs for reference: [_`README1`_](https://github.com/Electrical-Subsystem/Insystem-Programming/blob/master/README.md), [_`README2`_](https://github.com/Electrical-Subsystem/Insystem-Programming/blob/master/scripts/README.md)      

- Include only the C files and the necessary header files

- Make sure that your code is [indented](https://blog.prog`ramminghub.io/blog/2017/06/07importance-indentation-programming/) 

- Add an issue corresponding to your task
